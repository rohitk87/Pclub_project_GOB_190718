# Game Of Blocks
Game of Blocks project repository of Rohit Kumar ``(kmrrohit@iitk.ac.in/190718)``.

## Preliminary Project 

For the initial project submission, I have used the one I prepared in class 12th. All the inputs and outputs are clearly specified in the code, execute the code and you can navigate easily. I have used fundamentals of ``binary file management`` and ``classes`` in the program. 

## Assignments

All the respective assignments have been sorted in their folders, with ``README.md`` included for each. I have used ``JavaScript`` for the first project and mainly ``Solidity`` for the rest. This project in general deals with developing ``Smart Contracts`` on the ethereum blockchain using Solidity.
